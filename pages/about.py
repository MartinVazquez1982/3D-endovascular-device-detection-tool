This experience for Systems Engineers explored the application of artificial intelligence in medicine, enhancing both diagnosis and treatment. The project followed a combined approach, leveraging both in-person and remote work, with fixed schedules and seamless communication with the Yatiris team. A cyclical methodology of training and evaluation was utilized to optimize the segmentation model's performance, employing tools such as PyTorch, SLURM, and Slicer 3D.")
